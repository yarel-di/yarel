From 11th June 2021, I consider the devolpment of Yarel frozen. I thank students and research technicians who helped me to develop ideas on the meaning of reversible computational models through Yarel's implementation. It is probable, but not certain, that Yarel will be redesigned from the beginning, according to other technological tools and conceptual principles.
