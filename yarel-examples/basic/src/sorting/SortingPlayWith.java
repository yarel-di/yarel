/**
 * Automatically generated usage class.<p>
 *
 * This is a draft, providing examples of instantiation and usage and invocation,
 * in a Java context, of the functions/operators written in Yarel. <br>
 * In further developments, this will be a JUnit class.<br>
 * For instance, currently this tests looks like:
 * <pre><code>
 	int[] data = {8 3 0 0 0};
 	RPP op = new Some_5ary_Operator();
 	op.b(data);
 * </pre></code>
 * For further informations, check the documentation:
 * <ul>
 * <li> {@link RPP}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 *
 * NOTE:<br>
 * The following "usages" not tests, they are just invocations over a pre-determined dataset
 * that requires to be manually observed and verified and has currently nothing related
 * with the "semantic"/meaning/functionality of the executed operator. That means that the
 * inputs and the outputs are currently "static" and unrelated with the expected inputs and outputs
 * of the functions. (This is a "further development".)<br>
 * For instance, an operator could expect to receive some registers as input values and others
 * as 0-ancillae or 1-ancillae (or "truth-pair"). <br>
 * Currently, that information cannot be provided in this current version of the Yarel language,
 * so some automatic validation, formal or informal, cannot be performed.<br>
 * In short, <strong>You</strong>, the programmer, has to run the class, read the console output
 * and see the results.
 * <p>
 * TL;DR:<p>
 * This class is, or presents: <br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Instantiation and invocation of the compiled {@link RPP} subclasses.</li>
 * <li>Those instances runs on meaningless example data.</li>
 * <li>Manual check required by <strong>You</strong> yourself by <italic>reading</italic> the <code>console output</code></li>
 * <li><i>Wanna-be</i> JUnit</li>
 * </ul>
